# Hi There üëã

# üí´ About Me:
"I'm Zeyad from Egypt. As a content creator on TikTok, I enjoy sharing knowledge through quiz time videos. While pursuing my Bachelor of Dental Surgery at [furutre universtiy], I've also dedicated myself to online learning. My journey began with a digital marketing course on Udacity three years ago. Now, I'm diving deep into the world of Python and am captivated by the intricacies of machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI). I'm eager to master these technologies, train effective models, and apply them to solve real-world problems. Currently, I'm enrolled in the AWS Intro to ML/AI course and have dedicated time to training models. Additionally, I'm a proud recipient of the ALX scholarship for virtual assistance, further honing my skills in digital communication and problem-solving. My expected graduation date from dental college is Spring 2026."
